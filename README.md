**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

This code comprises a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed to be played in the console. The game includes functions to generate the computer's choice randomly, prompt the player for their choice, and determine the winner of each round. It also manages a 5-round game and displays the results.

**Functions:**
- `getComputerChoice()`: Generates a random choice for the computer between 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
- `getPlayerChoice()`: Prompts the player to enter their choice ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors').
- `playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)`: Determines the winner for a round based on the choices made by the player and the computer.
- `game()`: Orchestrates a 5-round game between the player and computer, tracking wins and displaying results after each round.

**How to Play:**
1. The game starts when executed.
2. For each round, the player inputs their choice when prompted.
3. The computer randomly selects its choice.
4. The game determines the winner for each round and displays the results in the console.
5. After 5 rounds, the final result (whether the player wins, the computer wins, or it's a tie) is displayed.

The outcome of the game is shown in the console, declaring whether the player or computer wins or if it ends in a tie.

The game logic is implemented through functions and loops to create an interactive experience within the console environment, simulating the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
