### JavaScript Functions
- `getComputerChoice()` generates a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
- `playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)` determines the winner for a round based on the player's and computer's choices.
- `handlePlayerChoice()` handles player interaction by detecting button clicks and triggering game rounds.
- `updateScore(result)` updates the score and checks for game completion.
- `disableButtons()` disables buttons after the game ends.

### CSS Styling
The CSS file styles the game interface, utilizing background images, button styles, text formatting, and layout adjustments for a visually appealing experience.


The game logic is implemented using event listeners, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling to create an engaging and user-friendly Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the web.
